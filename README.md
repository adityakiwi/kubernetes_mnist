# kubernetes_mnist
For this homework assignment, our job was to try and run an MNIST machine inside a docker container using Kubernetes and IBM cloud. In this case, what is seen is that MNIST can be based on PyTorch or TensorFlow to be able to understand and know more about how docker works. In this case, we had first to set up docker itself so we could begin and create the container process and then understand how docker is able to work on making a consistent environment where one can easily be able to keep things in the same flow and understand how to implement it in the actual cloud and then a front end API with Flask to interact with the app.
