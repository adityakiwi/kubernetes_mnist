# docker_mnistlab

For this homework assignment, our job was to try and run MNIST inside a docker container. In this case, what is seen is that MNIST can be based on PyTorch or TensorFlow to be able to understand and know more about how docker works. In this case, we had first to set up docker itself so we could begin and create the container process and then understand how docker is able to work on making a consistent environment where one can easily be able to keep things in the same flow.
